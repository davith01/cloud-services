## Versioning

For transparency into our release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility, Bootstrap is maintained under [the Semantic Versioning guidelines](http://semver.org/). Sometimes we screw up, but we'll adhere to those rules whenever possible.

See [the Releases section of our GitHub project](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases) for changelogs for each release version of Bootstrap. Release announcement posts on [the official Bootstrap blog](http://blog.getbootstrap.com) contain summaries of the most noteworthy changes made in each release.
